# NEXT

## ▶ Kickoff kit written (2026-10-29). Next: Phase 1 planning session per KICKOFF.md (stops after the plan; Shane reviews before any build).

**Kickoff session (2026-10-29, cloud, Shane present).**
- Owner decisions: public repo, homelab theme, Commons runs alone (D-1..D-3).
- Kit: PRD v1.1 (homelab, Footnote replaces "Askboard" in P1-4, phasing amended per D-6), CLAUDE.md, KICKOFF.md, decisions D-4..D-18 + O-1..O-3, domain brief, ADR-001 (proposed), overlap check, Phase 1 tasks, `rules/ranking.json`, `rules/limits.json`, `tools/rankinglib.py` + `tools/golden_answers.py`.
- Gate output: `python3 -I tools/golden_answers.py` → `18 cases OK`. Two values hand-checked: hot(50, 0, T0) = 14650.6766811, wilson(70, 100) = 0.60415.
- Template: v1.4.0 is the latest tag (D-4). Port 7500 proposed, **unverified** against `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (D-5).
- Not done here: no template clone, no `npm ci`, no app code. `main` doesn't exist on origin yet; the Phase 1 session pushes the untouched template v1.4.0 as `main` and builds on `phase-1`.

**By hand (Shane):** see KICKOFF.md § Still to do by hand.
